Hello,

This repositiory is just to help you all in getting started with some generic commands used in Ambari Infra Solr and Apache Solr. I have tried to consolidate the information which is scattered and contains some links and generic commands.

Also, I have taken help from some of the Senior COEs while creating this repository and has some of their case updates which I found to be very helpful in day to day to scenarios.

Please get back to me if you need any clarification on commands and information that is present there.
